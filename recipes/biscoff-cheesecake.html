      <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <h3>For the Base</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>200g Biscoff biscuits (Crushed)</li>
        <li>80g Unsalted Butter (Melted)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>For the Cheesecake mixture</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>300ml Double cream</li>
        <li>400g Full fat cream cheese</li>
        <li>200g Biscoff spread</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>For the Topping</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>150g Biscoff spread (Melted)</li>
        <li>50g Biscoff biscuits (Crushed)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Combine the crushed biscoff biscuits with the melted butter and press
          into a tin. Chill in the fridge while you make the topping.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour the double cream into a bowl, add the cream cheese and Biscoff
          spread. Whisk until it's very thick â€“ almost the consistency of ice
          cream. Use an electric whisk if you have one.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the base from the fridge and add the cheesecake mixture,
          smoothing the top.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pop into the fridge for at least 3 hours (or overnight is much better
          if you don't need it until the next day).
        </li>
        <li>
          When you are almost ready to serve the cheesecake, melt the Biscoff
          spread very gently in a pan. (Don't let it get hot.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the cheesecake from the fridge and, while still in the tin,
          pour the melted Biscoff over the top. Smooth it out very gently with
          the back of a spoon, until the top is completely covered. (Take care
          not to touch the cheesecake mixture.) Sprinkle the remaining crushed
          biscuits around the edge.
        </li>
        <li>
          Return the cheesecake to the fridge for at least a further hour if you
          have the time. You could cut it sooner but it won't be as neat.
        </li>
      </ol>
